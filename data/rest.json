People who earn their livings picking fruit were going about their daily routines. All of a sudden, residents of Bakersfield and the surrounding area started disappearing.\nMaricela Sanchez, an investigator at the ACLU of Northern California, started seeing photos and videos in her social media feed of U.S. Border Patrol trucks stopping people by the side of the road.\nShe knew their presence in this area was highly unusual. So she immediately notified the ACLU NorCal legal team. She also reached out to our ACLU affiliate in Southern California. They started keeping tabs on what people on the ground were reporting about federal agents stopping and arresting people for no reason—other than their skin color.\n“I was in complete shock. I was devasted, stressed out and very worried about my community,” Sanchez remembers. “I’m born and raised in the Central Valley, and I have family who were agricultural workers.”\nOur partner, Kern County Rapid Response Network, took to Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok to sound the alarm. The Network is made up of volunteers, community members, and immigration advocates who respond to and verify ICE activity in their communities.\nThey warned people: Be careful. Remember your right to stay silent and to decline a search. Don’t open your door.\nBorder Patrol agents were snatching people from their cars, some of which were left abandoned by the side of the road. They grabbed farm workers from a coffee shop and arrested several others at a popular gas station.\nThey smashed people’s car windows and slashed their tires. They threw a grandmother to the ground. Legal residents and U.S. citizens were detained. They did all this unlawfully and without warrants.\nFrantic family members, meanwhile, were searching the ICE detention locator website for names of their loved ones. People thought at first that ICE was behind the raids and Border Patrol was just helping out. But none of the names of the people they were looking for were showing up in the locator.\nAround midnight on the third day of the raids, Bree Bernwanger, a senior attorney at ACLU NorCal, decided to check the ICE locator again before going to bed. She typed in the name of someone who’d been arrested. Up popped, “in CBP custody,” short for “Customs and Border Protection”—the parent agency for Border Patrol.\n“It didn’t say where, but that’s when it really sunk in that whatever was going on was unlike anything we had ever seen before,” said Bernwanger. “Certainly unlike anything I’d ever seen before.”\nShe would eventually learn that Border Patrol agents from near the U.S.-Mexico border had come 300 miles to Bakersfield to conduct raids over several days. Their own records show they had arrested 78 people and transported them hundreds of miles back to their station near the border. There, they locked detainees in frigid cells without blankets, deprived them of food, and refused to allow them to speak to a lawyer.\nIt was a cruel tactic to strip people of their right to an immigration hearing and coerce them instead into agreeing to “voluntary departure”—a form of expulsion that bars someone from returning to the U.S. for up to 10 years and rips them away from their families.\nBorder Patrol officials were threatening to extend the unlawful raids up to Fresno and Sacramento. We knew we had to stop them.\nWhat then ensued over the next frenzied seven weeks was a full-court press by a team of attorneys and investigators from the ACLU’s California affiliates and immigrants’ rights advocates, working with people who had been stopped and arrested, many of whom were forcibly returned to Mexico, and their family members left behind.\nWe decided to file a federal class action lawsuit to get an order blocking Border Patrol from further terrorizing immigrant communities in Kern County. But first we had to build a solid legal case challenging the inhumane and despicable Border Patrol operation dubbed “Operation Return to Sender.”\nAnd so began an intensive and painstaking fact-gathering process.\nThe ACLU team identified five Kern County residents to be plaintiffs, along with the United Farm Workers (UFW). The law firm Keker, Van Nest & Peters LLP, joined the effort as our pro bono partner.\nOn February 26, we filed a class action lawsuit against Department of Homeland Security, CBP, and U.S. Border Patrol officials over their pattern and practice of violating people’s Fourth Amendment rights against arrest without probable cause, and federal law. Soon after, we moved for a preliminary injunction to stop Border Patrol’s unlawful practices while the lawsuit was pending.\nOn April 28, U.S. District Judge Jennifer Thurston held the first hearing on the case in the federal courthouse in Fresno. Immigrants’ rights advocates and community members packed the courtroom. UFW organizers filed in with their red UFW shirts and sat in the front row. Local public defenders, ACLU staff members, volunteers, and others turned out to show solidarity with all of those who’d been arrested and could not be there.\nThe government couldn’t present a single fact to refute our clients’ claims that federal agents had violated their constitutional rights even when pressed to do so by the judge.\nThe next morning, in a huge victory for civil rights, Judge Thurston issued a preliminary injunction covering the Eastern District federal court, which encompasses the entire California Central Valley. The order bars U.S. Border Patrol from stopping people in violation of the Fourth Amendment or arresting them without complying with federal law.\nThe order states that agents cannot stop someone unless they have a valid, specific reason to suspect that they are not citizens. The fact that a person’s skin is brown is not a valid reason.\nSimilarly, Border Patrol must have probable cause to believe someone is likely to flee in order to arrest them without a warrant.\nThe judge further ruled that Border Patrol must document all future stops and warrantless arrests and provide that information to the plaintiffs in the lawsuit every 60 days.\nTime will tell how the case ultimately plays out. But as Trump continues to run roughshod over civil liberties, this ruling at least makes it clear that immigration agencies are bound by the law. The ACLU in California and across the country will continue to fight Trump’s racist and unlawful mass deportations.\nTammerlin Drummond is a principal communications strategist at the ACLU of Northern California.",

People who earn their livings picking fruit were going about their daily routines. All of a sudden, residents of Bakersfield and the surrounding area started disappearing.\nMaricela Sanchez, an investigator at the ACLU of Northern California, started seeing photos and videos in her social media feed of U.S. Border Patrol trucks stopping people by the side of the road.\nShe knew their presence in this area was highly unusual. So she immediately notified the ACLU NorCal legal team. She also reached out to our ACLU affiliate in Southern California. They started keeping tabs on what people on the ground were reporting about federal agents stopping and arresting people for no reason—other than their skin color.\n“I was in complete shock. I was devasted, stressed out and very worried about my community,” Sanchez remembers. “I’m born and raised in the Central Valley, and I have family who were agricultural workers.”\nOur partner, Kern County Rapid Response Network, took to Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok to sound the alarm. The Network is made up of volunteers, community members, and immigration advocates who respond to and verify ICE activity in their communities.\nThey warned people: Be careful. Remember your right to stay silent and to decline a search. Don’t open your door.\nBorder Patrol agents were snatching people from their cars, some of which were left abandoned by the side of the road. They grabbed farm workers from a coffee shop and arrested several others at a popular gas station.\nThey smashed people’s car windows and slashed their tires. They threw a grandmother to the ground. Legal residents and U.S. citizens were detained. They did all this unlawfully and without warrants.\nFrantic family members, meanwhile, were searching the ICE detention locator website for names of their loved ones. People thought at first that ICE was behind the raids and Border Patrol was just helping out. But none of the names of the people they were looking for were showing up in the locator.\nAround midnight on the third day of the raids, Bree Bernwanger, a senior attorney at ACLU NorCal, decided to check the ICE locator again before going to bed. She typed in the name of someone who’d been arrested. Up popped, “in CBP custody,” short for “Customs and Border Protection”—the parent agency for Border Patrol.\n“It didn’t say where, but that’s when it really sunk in that whatever was going on was unlike anything we had ever seen before,” said Bernwanger. “Certainly unlike anything I’d ever seen before.”\nShe would eventually learn that Border Patrol agents from near the U.S.-Mexico border had come 300 miles to Bakersfield to conduct raids over several days. Their own records show they had arrested 78 people and transported them hundreds of miles back to their station near the border. There, they locked detainees in frigid cells without blankets, deprived them of food, and refused to allow them to speak to a lawyer.\nIt was a cruel tactic to strip people of their right to an immigration hearing and coerce them instead into agreeing to “voluntary departure”—a form of expulsion that bars someone from returning to the U.S. for up to 10 years and rips them away from their families.\nBorder Patrol officials were threatening to extend the unlawful raids up to Fresno and Sacramento. We knew we had to stop them.\nWhat then ensued over the next frenzied seven weeks was a full-court press by a team of attorneys and investigators from the ACLU’s California affiliates and immigrants’ rights advocates, working with people who had been stopped and arrested, many of whom were forcibly returned to Mexico, and their family members left behind.\nWe decided to file a federal class action lawsuit to get an order blocking Border Patrol from further terrorizing immigrant communities in Kern County. But first we had to build a solid legal case challenging the inhumane and despicable Border Patrol operation dubbed “Operation Return to Sender.”\nAnd so began an intensive and painstaking fact-gathering process.\nThe ACLU team identified five Kern County residents to be plaintiffs, along with the United Farm Workers (UFW). The law firm Keker, Van Nest & Peters LLP, joined the effort as our pro bono partner.\nOn February 26, we filed a class action lawsuit against Department of Homeland Security, CBP, and U.S. Border Patrol officials over their pattern and practice of violating people’s Fourth Amendment rights against arrest without probable cause, and federal law. Soon after, we moved for a preliminary injunction to stop Border Patrol’s unlawful practices while the lawsuit was pending.\nOn April 28, U.S. District Judge Jennifer Thurston held the first hearing on the case in the federal courthouse in Fresno. Immigrants’ rights advocates and community members packed the courtroom. UFW organizers filed in with their red UFW shirts and sat in the front row. Local public defenders, ACLU staff members, volunteers, and others turned out to show solidarity with all of those who’d been arrested and could not be there.\nThe government couldn’t present a single fact to refute our clients’ claims that federal agents had violated their constitutional rights even when pressed to do so by the judge.\nThe next morning, in a huge victory for civil rights, Judge Thurston issued a preliminary injunction covering the Eastern District federal court, which encompasses the entire California Central Valley. The order bars U.S. Border Patrol from stopping people in violation of the Fourth Amendment or arresting them without complying with federal law.\nThe order states that agents cannot stop someone unless they have a valid, specific reason to suspect that they are not citizens. The fact that a person’s skin is brown is not a valid reason.\nSimilarly, Border Patrol must have probable cause to believe someone is likely to flee in order to arrest them without a warrant.\nThe judge further ruled that Border Patrol must document all future stops and warrantless arrests and provide that information to the plaintiffs in the lawsuit every 60 days.\nTime will tell how the case ultimately plays out. But as Trump continues to run roughshod over civil liberties, this ruling at least makes it clear that immigration agencies are bound by the law. The ACLU in California and across the country will continue to fight Trump’s racist and unlawful mass deportations.\nTammerlin Drummond is a principal communications strategist at the ACLU of Northern California.",

Please read with care.Sydney Sweeney, known for her roles in Euphoria and The White Lotus, recently faced public scrutiny after appearing in American Eagle’s fall 2025 campaign, which featured the tagline: “Sydney Sweeney Has Great Jeans.”While seemingly a clever fashion pun, playing on \"jeans\" and \"genes,\" many online commentators found the phrase racially charged. They argued that using \"great genes\" to describe a white, blonde woman, especially in a solo campaign, evoked associations with the eugenics movement and ideas of racial \"purity.\"It is unlikely that the campaign intended to endorse white supremacy. However, this article aims to explore the significance of unintentional harm, which warrants attention.Why “Great Genes” Isn’t Just Wordplay: A History of Eugenics and ExclusionIn the early 20th century, “good genes” was a phrase associated with control, not compliments. The American eugenics movement advocated for selective breeding to “improve” society. This often meant discouraging interbreeding with other ethnic groups or forcibly sterilizing people with disabilities, immigrants, and particularly Black and Indigenous individuals.Books such as The Passing of the Great Race paved the way for U.S. laws that led to the sterilization of over 60,000 people. These concepts also significantly influenced Nazi Germany’s “Aryan race” ideology.When a campaign highlights a white, conventionally attractive actress as having “great genes,” it inadvertently echoes this troubling past, especially if the message lacks racial or body diversity to provide a balanced perspective.The Hidden History of Denim: How Blue Jeans Are Tied to Black LaborDenim, a fabric often associated with youth, rebellion, and American culture, has roots in Black oppression. Its popularity in the 1800s stemmed from its affordability and durability, making it ideal for enslaved Black individuals forced into manual labor on plantations and in factories. These enslaved Black tailors and seamstresses were not only responsible for making these clothes but also contributed to their functional design.As educator and historian @evolvedteacher (Gahmya Drummond-Bey) highlighted on Threads, this history is often erased: \"They’ll tell you denim came from France. They’ll tell you you’re ‘reading too much into it.’\"This serves as a crucial reminder that mainstream narratives frequently obscure uncomfortable truths. In reality, Black labor, exploitation, and ingenuity profoundly shaped denim in the U.S.. The fabric's narrative is inextricably linked to this history.The irony is stark: a fall fashion campaign featuring a cis, white woman in light-washed denim, captioned \"great jeans,\" inadvertently erases the contributions and suffering of the very people who made denim iconic, simply by omitting Black history.Public Reactions: A Divided ResponseThe campaign ignited diverse social media reactions. Many Black creators and cultural critics expressed hurt and exhaustion, labeling the campaign racially insensitive and historically dismissive. Conversely, some defended Sydney, suggesting critics were \"overreacting\" or \"twisting\" the message. A segment, particularly right-wing influencers, dismissed the backlash as a \"woke mob\" phenomenon.Throughout this controversy, neither American Eagle nor Sydney Sweeney issued an official apology. Sweeney's silence, in particular, led to speculation about whether she was ignoring the repercussions or privately contemplating the situation.Donald Trump’s Reaction: Culture-War FuelThe controversy surrounding the American Eagle ad intensified politically when Donald Trump publicly endorsed Sydney Sweeney after discovering she’s a registered Republican. His remarks, amplified by the Instagram account @progressivesfortn, included:“Sydney Sweeney, a registered Republican, has the ‘hottest’ ad out there. It’s for American Eagle.”On Truth Social, he further commented:“Go get em’ Sydney! Being ‘woke” is for losers, being Republican is what you want to be.”Trump also used the opportunity to criticize Taylor Swift, stating Sweeney was “hot” and Swift was “no longer hot” because of her Democratic sympathies, illustrating how the advertisement became a tool in partisan political maneuvering.GOP Allies Rally Around SweeneyConservative figures, following Trump's lead, quickly came to Sweeney's defense. Vice President J.D. Vance dismissed critics as \"hysterical,\" suggesting they were calling her a \"Nazi\" simply for \"looking good in jeans.\"On Fox News, Fox & Friends commentator Lawrence Jones praised Sweeney's gun-range video and appearance, stating that every time he sees young women who can \"shoot,\" their \"value\" increases. Similarly, Trump's communications director, Steven Cheung, labeled the backlash \"cancel culture run amok\" (despite it not being cancel culture) and attributed it to \"liberal warped thinking.\"The overarching message conveyed was that Sydney Sweeney is a \"victim\" of \"leftist overreach\" and embodies anti-woke American values.Sydney, You Can Learn, and LeadThis situation isn't about condemning Sydney Sweeney; it's an opportunity to encourage her and others to grasp the broader context of the art and advertisements they engage with.Here's how this growth can manifest:Embrace constructive criticism: Listen to feedback without becoming defensive.Understand historical context: Learn the origins and meanings behind visuals and language.Amplify unheard voices: Use your platform to support marginalized communities and show your commitment.Sydney has been praised for her genuine and professional approach to acting. These same qualities can be applied here. She doesn't need to become an activist, but she can acknowledge any harm caused and use it as a catalyst for personal development.Final Thoughts: Compassion + Accountability = ChangeThis denim controversy transcends mere fashion; it highlights the cultural significance of clothing, language, and imagery, particularly within a nation still grappling with its racial past.Sydney, this isn't about assigning blame. It's about recognizing your capacity for growth and your commitment to improvement. If this occurs, the campaign will achieve more than just selling jeans—it will ignite something far more significant.Resources for Further LearningArticles and PostsSnopes Fact-Check on the AdThreads Post by @nikjenkinss@inclusivestylist’s Instagram BreakdownPhiladelphia Tribune–“Enslaved Blacks Invented Blue Jeans”@evolvedteacher Threads Post on Denim History@progressivesfortn Instagram Post on Trump’s ResponseVideosPBS: Race, Slavery, and Blue JeansThe Story Behind Denim’s Racial HistoryAnother Documentary on the Denim-Slavery LinkAnalysisBooksEventsFiguresGeneralLessonsModernNarrativesPerspectivesResearchTriviaWorld HistoryDiscoveriesAbout the CreatorJenna DeedyJust a New England Mando passionate about wildlife, nerd stuff & cosplay! 🐾✨🎭 Get 20% off @davidsonsteas (https://www.davidsonstea.com/) with code JENNA20-Based in Nashua, NH.Instagram: @jennacostadeedyReader insightsBe the first to share your insights about this piece.How does it work?Add your insightsComments There are no comments for this storyBe the first to respond and start the conversation.Sign in to commentKeep readingMore stories from Jenna Deedy and writers in History and other communities.From Theaters to Streaming: Why the Future of Marvel Films Likely Belongs to Disney+\nAuthor’s Note: This article is a continuation of ideas first explored in my previous piece, “From Infinity Saga to Chicken Jockey: The Changing Face of Moviegoing”, which can be found on my Vocal page.

Being ‘woke” is for losers, being Republican is what you want to be.”Trump also used the opportunity to criticize Taylor Swift, stating Sweeney was “hot” and Swift was “no longer hot” because of her Democratic sympathies, illustrating how the advertisement became a tool in partisan political maneuvering.GOP Allies Rally Around SweeneyConservative figures, following Trump's lead, quickly came to Sweeney's defense. Vice President J.D. Vance dismissed critics as \"hysterical,\" suggesting they were calling her a \"Nazi\" simply for \"looking good in jeans.\"On Fox News, Fox & Friends commentator Lawrence Jones praised Sweeney's gun-range video and appearance, stating that every time he sees young women who can \"shoot,\" their \"value\" increases. Similarly, Trump's communications director, Steven Cheung, labeled the backlash \"cancel culture run amok\" (despite it not being cancel culture) and attributed it to \"liberal warped thinking.\"The overarching message conveyed was that Sydney Sweeney is a \"victim\" of \"leftist overreach\" and embodies anti-woke American values.Sydney, You Can Learn, and LeadThis situation isn't about condemning Sydney Sweeney; it's an opportunity to encourage her and others to grasp the broader context of the art and advertisements they engage with.Here's how this growth can manifest:Embrace constructive criticism: Listen to feedback without becoming defensive.Understand historical context: Learn the origins and meanings behind visuals and language.Amplify unheard voices: Use your platform to support marginalized communities and show your commitment.Sydney has been praised for her genuine and professional approach to acting. These same qualities can be applied here. She doesn't need to become an activist, but she can acknowledge any harm caused and use it as a catalyst for personal development.Final Thoughts: Compassion + Accountability = ChangeThis denim controversy transcends mere fashion; it highlights the cultural significance of clothing, language, and imagery, particularly within a nation still grappling with its racial past.Sydney, this isn't about assigning blame. It's about recognizing your capacity for growth and your commitment to improvement. If this occurs, the campaign will achieve more than just selling jeans—it will ignite something far more significant.Resources for Further LearningArticles and PostsSnopes Fact-Check on the AdThreads Post by @nikjenkinss@inclusivestylist’s Instagram BreakdownPhiladelphia Tribune–“Enslaved Blacks Invented Blue Jeans”@evolvedteacher Threads Post on Denim History@progressivesfortn Instagram Post on Trump’s ResponseVideosPBS: Race, Slavery, and Blue JeansThe Story Behind Denim’s Racial HistoryAnother Documentary on the Denim-Slavery LinkAnalysisBooksEventsFiguresGeneralLessonsModernNarrativesPerspectivesResearchTriviaWorld HistoryDiscoveriesAbout the CreatorJenna DeedyJust a New England Mando passionate about wildlife, nerd stuff & cosplay! 🐾✨🎭 Get 20% off @davidsonsteas (https://www.davidsonstea.com/) with code JENNA20-Based in Nashua, NH.Instagram: @jennacostadeedyReader insightsBe the first to share your insights about this piece.How does it work?Add your insightsComments There are no comments for this storyBe the first to respond and start the conversation.Sign in to commentKeep readingMore stories from Jenna Deedy and writers in History and other communities.From Theaters to Streaming: Why the Future of Marvel Films Likely Belongs to Disney+\nAuthor’s Note: This article is a continuation of ideas first explored in my previous piece, “From Infinity Saga to Chicken Jockey: The Changing Face of Moviegoing”, which can be found on my Vocal page.

These biological  issues also affect mental and cognitive health brain health, increasing the chances of developing brain diseases such as dementia and Alzheimer’s.\n\t\n\t\nFrom mood disorders like depression to chronic psychiatric conditions like schizophrenia, mental illness in Black America has long been under-diagnosed and untreated.

Trump’s assault on free-market capitalismBy Jeffrey SonnenfeldBy John PepperBy Anne MulcahyBy Bill GeorgeBy Laura TysonBy Jeffrey SonnenfeldJeffrey SonnenfeldJeffrey Sonnenfeld is the Lester Crown Professor in Management Practice and Senior Associate Dean at Yale School of Management.SEE FULL BIOBy John PepperSEE MORE \nJeffrey Sonnenfeld is Lester Crown Professor of Leadership Practice at the Yale School of Management and founder of the Yale Chief Executive Leadership Institute.\n\n\n\nJohn Pepper was CEO and chairman of Proctor & Gamble, was chairman of the board of The Walt Disney Company and served on the boards of Motorola, Xerox, and Boston Scientific.\n\n\n\nAnne Mulcahy was CEO and chairwoman of Xerox and served on the boards of Johnson & Johnson, Citigroup, and Target.\n\n\n\nBill George was CEO and chairman of Medtronic and served on the boards of Exxon, Goldman Sacks, Target, and Novartis.\n\n\n\nLaura Tyson is the former chairman of the White House Counsel of Economic Advisers. The distinguished professor at the University of California, Berkeley, she was formerly dean of the Haas School of Business, and she now chairs the Board of Trustees at UC Berkeley’s Blum Center for Developing Economies.\nPresident Trump's assaults on free-market capitalism are almost too numerous to name.Yuri Gripas/Abaca/Bloomberg via Getty ImagesAs many CEOs understandably grew horrified last month at the prospect that New York City, the capital of capitalism, is on the brink of going socialist with the mayoral momentum of the inexperienced candidate Zohran Mamdani, they were ignoring the greater assault on free market capitalism that has already overtaken the nation in the Republican Party. While we agree that Mamdani’s solutions to affordable housing and grocery prices threaten to undermine free markets by bowing to the appeal of populist anger, President Donald Trump has already begun doing so, but to suit his own grandiose political agenda instead. \n\n\n\nUnlike any leader of any free-market economy around the world, President Trump has seized control of private enterprise’s strategic decision-making and investment policies while invading corporate board rooms so that he may dictate leadership staffing, punish corporate critics, and demand public compliance with his political agenda. This is far more dangerous to capitalism than a city-run grocery store.\n\n\n\nMany free-market economists and business leaders who have long worshipped the free-market ideals of Adam Smith, Friedrich Hayek, Ayn Rand, and Milton Friedman should be aware that their idols would be rolling in their graves right now, as rather than pursue standard laissez-faire conservative economic policies, MAGA has gone Marxist and even, increasingly, Maoist.\n\n\n\nAs Greg Ip warned this week in The Wall Street Journal, “The US marches toward state capitalism with American characteristics … President Trump is imitating [the] Chinese Communist Party by extending political control ever deeper into the economy.”  Ip pointed out that in the past, crisis-driven government bailouts of the banking and automotive sectors, such as TARP, were acute, targeted assistance, with brief and bipartisan rescue aims. Similarly, government incentives to drive investments in chips manufacturing, oil exploration, space exploration, internet development, agricultural vitality, cancer detection, disease treatment, and clean energy were not ownership deals with preferred companies or corporate cronies.  \n\n\n\nIndeed, Ip’s warnings mirror our own, as we were the first to accurately, presciently warn—over a year ago—that many of Trump’s economic positions more closely resemble communism than capitalism, as part of what we called “the coming MAGA assault on capitalism.” It certainly looks like MAGA is going Marxist if not even Maoist, especially across Trump’s vicious personal targeting of individual business leaders; government crackdown on business freedom of expression; weaponization of government powers; apparent extortion of businesses; and insertion of government into an unprecedented, outsized role in private sector strategic investment, capital flows and business decision-making.\n\n\n\nMarxism and Maoism were both, of course, expressions of the communist theory that spilled forth from Karl Marx’s pen in the 19th century, brought to life in the brutal one-party states of the Soviet Union and the People’s Republic of China under its leader Mao Zedong, before it evolved into “capitalism with Chinese characteristics” starting in the 1970s, around the time of President Richard Nixon’s fateful visit to Beijing. \n\n\n\nBoth Marxism and Maoism claimed to champion “ordinary people” against corrupt or exploitative elites, while both targeted intellectuals, bureaucrats, and traditionalists, and purged institutions to enforce ideological purity, especially during Stalin’s “Great Terror” and Mao’s “Cultural Revolution.” Both centralized leadership to the point of creating a cult of personality, demanding intense loyalty and the glorification of the sole figure who could fix the country’s problems. Both prized loyalty over expertise, sidelining critics and dissenters in favor of a tightly controlled political narrative. Sound familiar?\n\n\n\nThe essence of market capitalism is that owners—shareholders and the management they appoint share in the profits. These deals give share of profits to government in return for favors. Friedman said that federal government should never own anything—that it should not run a surplus because it would have funds to invest in the private sector. What strategic decision-making rights would the government have in such deals, then?\n\n\n\nAssaults targeting individual business leaders\n\n\n\nTrump has a long history of targeting individual CEOs in highly vicious, personal terms for perceived offenses. This week, Trump called for the firing of Goldman Sachs’ renowned economist Jan Hatzius who accurately called the 2008 financial crisis over the economist’s concern regarding the tariff overhand on the US economy. He also attacked a top-performing financier, David Solomon, the non-partisan CEO of Goldman Sachs, telling him to quit and just be a disc jockey. (Solomon has a famous side hustle as an electronic dance music DJ, known as DJ D-Sol.)\n\n\n\nJust last week, many semiconductor industry observers expressed tremendous discomfort with Trump’s attacks on Lip-Bu Tan, the CEO of Intel, and Trump’s calls for his immediate resignation. Even those who are genuinely concerned by Tan’s documented history of CCP ties and his continuing investments in China, would have preferred that Trump express his views in a more subtle fashion which recognizes the widespread entanglements of the Chinese Communist Party in the largest Chinese businesses. Roughly one-third of the Chinese economy is controlled by CCP-owned enterprises with actual CCP monitors in their boardrooms. Instead of calling this out, the Trump administration appears to want to match such corporate oversight itself.\n\n\n\nVirtually any CEO doing business in China works with companies and schools that have ties to People’s Liberation Army of China, given China’s own authoritarian command economy.  There has been great concern that such prominent Chinese businesses as Huawei, Aviation Industry Corporation of China (AVIC), China Telecom, China Mobile, and Hikvision have close ties to the PLA. Many state-owned enterprises with which most western enterprises do business even have militias with ties to the PLA. While this is concerning across political parties, how can President Trump justifying singling out Intel alone?\n\n\n\nTrump has similarly publicly called out and humiliated leading CEOs ranging from Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan to Brian Moynihan of Bank of America to Doug McMillon of Walmart to Tim Cook of Apple to Matt Levatich of Harley-Davidson, among many others, when they speak the truth about issues ranging from trade policies to HR practices to diplomacy to environmental sustainability.  \n\n\n\nThe unwarranted attack on Brian Moynihan and Bank of America—that they previously denied him as a customer—was particularly alarming as President Trump’s four bankruptcies were reasonable concerns when major banks were approached about lending to him. Bewilderingly, Deutsche Bank’s private wealth unit loaned Trump $48 million—following his default on a $640 million loan from Deutsche Bank’s commercial unit. Now regulators are being told by the Trump Administration to withdraw reputation risk as criteria for reviewing prudent banking practices.\n\n\n\nSuppressing business freedom of expression in favor of political obedience\n\n\n\nThe political right used to complain about the “political correctness of the left.” Similarly, Trump’s history of cracking down on businesses for exercising their freedom of expression resembles the purges of Maoist China far more than American democratic norms.\n\n\n\nFor example, when Merck CEO Ken Frazier resigned from Trump’s Manufacturing Councils in protest over Trump’s infamous response to the Charlottesville rally, claiming there were “fine people” on both sides, Trump lashed out at Frazier, mocking him by saying he’d now have “more time to lower ripoff drug prices”. Similarly, Trump has repeatedly attacked Jeff Bezos, claiming that Amazon was “stealing” from the US Postal Service in the aftermath of critical coverage by the Bezos-owned Washington Post.\n\n\n\nTrump FTC Chairman Andrew Ferguson has publicly challenged woke ideology as a part of his antitrust remit, arguing that “In 2020, if you had a view on masks that was inconsistent with how big tech felt about masks, you weren’t allowed to talk about it. If you had a view on vaccines, couldn’t talk about it. But it wasn’t just big tech censorship. That was a huge problem. Consumers couldn’t go into a store without having political messages pushed in their face. And I’m sitting in 2020 working in the Senate going, gosh, if companies feel like they can alienate half their consumer base without suffering any real competitive consequences, we probably have a competition problem.”\n\n\n\nSimilarly, Trump FCC Chair Brendan Carr has argued that he would use DEI as a basis to block mergers, declaring that “if there are businesses out there that are still promoting invidious forms of DEI discrimination, I really don’t see a path forward where the FCC could reach the conclusion that approving the transaction is going to be in the public interest.”\n\n\n\nAccordingly, to complete it acquisition of Paramount/CBS, David Ellison’s Skydance had to ensure review of its news reporting “to address bias and restore fact-based reporting” with a bias monitor as well as racial hiring practices which met the FCC’s standards under Carr.\n\n\n\nSeizing control of strategic investment and private enterprise decision-making\n\n\n\nAkin to Mao Zedong directing business decisions as a part of his wildly disastrous Great Leap Forward central economic planning initiative, Trump has plunged the US government headfirst into an unprecedented active role in directing private business decision-making and capital flows. Last month, he ordered Coca-Cola CEO James Quincey to replace cane sugar with other sweeteners that the firm uses, despite the lack of scientific evidence supporting such a move and despite the fact that the CEO of Coca-Cola is accountable to his board and shareholders, not Donald Trump.\n\n\n\nThis even extends to the US government directly receiving equity stakes, golden shares, and royalties from business revenues, sometimes as a part of complicated negotiations with the US government and giving off the appearance, whether warranted or not, of drug deals. For example, leading chipmakers Nvidia and AMD were just forced to surrender 15% of the revenue flows from their sales to China to the U.S. government, apparently as a concession to be able to continue selling in that market.\n\n\n\nSimilarly, as a precondition to approving the dangerous takeover of US Steel by the Japanese, Trump extracted a “golden share” for the U.S. government with effective veto power over certain corporate decisions. Likewise, in his first term, Trump attacked Harley-Davidson for supposedly moving factories overseas when in reality 100% of its beloved motorcycles sold in the U.S. are actually made in the U.S. Out of sheer political spite, Trump proclaimed that American bikers should buy from Harley’s foreign competitors, ranting that Harley had “surrendered” and “betrayed” America while threatening “they will be taxed like never before.”\n\n\n\nLikewise, Trump wrongly accused Ford of robbing Detroit of jobs when it relocated an engine plant from Europe to Mexico, fortifying its North American supply chain. When one of us personally corrected Trump on that, he replied, “I don’t care, it’s working.” At the same time, the home appliances firm Carrier had a parallel experience with Trump-bashing them, despite being located in Mike Pence’s home state of Indiana.\n\n\n\nPolitical weaponization of government powers \n\n\n\nTrump targeted AT&T with a drawn-out antitrust suit as well as numerous personal taunts when it tried to merge with Time Warner, hoping to pressure CNN to become more friendly in its coverage. In stark contrast, Trump pal Rupert Murdoch received the white-gloves treatment through antitrust when he sold 21st Century Fox at around the same time, despite arguably more genuine antitrust concerns. \n\n\n\nIn fact, Trump antitrust chief Makan Delrahim expressed support for the AT&T-Time Warner combination as an academic but flipped 180 degrees to appease Trump once in office, holding up the deal for two years. Likewise, before his first term ran out, Trump personally drove a proposed deal that would have secured TikTok for his longtime supporter and friend Larry Ellison at Oracle, unusually inserting himself into every detail of the negotiation process.\n\n\n\nThe appearance of extortion and bribery\n\n\n\nAs prominent media commentators such as Oliver Darcy and Matt Belloni point out, some of Trump’s demands resemble extortion. There was the payment of $16 million to the Trump Presidential Library from CBS News’ 60 Minutes over the standard editing of an interview with Kamala Harris last summer. This occurred over the objections of its executive producer (who resigned in protest), and while FCC approval was pending of Paramount’s acquisition by Skydance.\n\n\n\nThis was followed by the cancellation of the modern “King of Comedy,” Stephen Colbert, whose revered late show suddenly had its deal abruptly canceled on the eve of Trump’s FCC merger approval, seemingly over its satirical criticism of the Trump administration. The explanation that the show was too expensive and lost money raised many eyebrows, particularly given the lack of attempts to trim the 200-person production staff.\n\n\n\nSimilar lawsuits initiated by Trump in office against private businesses give off a similar appearance of extortion and bribery, whether justified or not. These include Trump’s $100 million lawsuit against The Wall Street Journal for reporting about a letter Trump wrote to Jeffrey Epstein for his 50th birthday; and Disney/ABC’s $15 million payment to the Trump Presidential Library to settle defamation claims against George Stephanopoulos.\n\n\n\nAcross each of these five dimensions, one can’t help but think MAGA is going Marxist or full Maoist. Adam Smith’s salute to the “invisible hand” of free markets in favor of the fist of government appears to be losing out in the Trump administration. as these unprecedented policies with no parallel in American history share much more in common with Karl Marx and Mao Zedong than Adam Smith and Ayn Rand. Many now wonder why the Business Roundtable remains missing in action, insulating itself with turgid knowledge, subtracting white papers and passive forums, piously genuflecting to President Trump’s assaults on free-market capitalism that make New York’s Mamdani look like John D. Rockefeller.\n\n\n\nThe Marxist-style oppression of free enterprise was echoed in assaults on the nation’s top law firms and universities through authoritarian blitzkriegs to suppress constitutionally protected American ideals of freedom of expression, a cornerstone of capitalism. Harvard University, like 60 other universities, has been threatened with a cutoff of foreign-born students and vital federal research funds under the false pretext of antisemitism, despite the Anti-Defamation League giving Harvard passing grades on its tests for antisemitism. Paul Weiss is one of many major law firms that the Trump administration threatened with having its security clearance and federal building access denied, merely by offering to represent independent citizen voices attacked by Trump for noncompliance with his thought police and MAGA political correctness. We have spoken in admiration of the hundreds of universities and law firms that have now unified to stop these totalitarian White House edicts. The legal and academic community remembered what the Business Roundtable and genuine traditional economic conservatives have forgotten, which was Benjamin Franklin’s admonition that “we must all hang together or surely we will hang separately.”\n\n\n\nThe authors would like to thank Steven Tian and Stephen Henriques from the Yale Chief Executive Leadership Institute for their research.\n\n\n\nThe opinions expressed in Fortune.com commentary pieces are solely the views of their authors and do not necessarily reflect the opinions and beliefs of Fortune.Introducing the 2025 Fortune Global 500, the definitive ranking of the biggest companies in the world.

This is far more dangerous to capitalism than a city-run grocery store.\n\n\n\nMany free-market economists and business leaders who have long worshipped the free-market ideals of Adam Smith, Friedrich Hayek, Ayn Rand, and Milton Friedman should be aware that their idols would be rolling in their graves right now, as rather than pursue standard laissez-faire conservative economic policies, MAGA has gone Marxist and even, increasingly, Maoist.\n\n\n\nAs Greg Ip warned this week in The Wall Street Journal, “The US marches toward state capitalism with American characteristics … President Trump is imitating [the] Chinese Communist Party by extending political control ever deeper into the economy.”  Ip pointed out that in the past, crisis-driven government bailouts of the banking and automotive sectors, such as TARP, were acute, targeted assistance, with brief and bipartisan rescue aims. Similarly, government incentives to drive investments in chips manufacturing, oil exploration, space exploration, internet development, agricultural vitality, cancer detection, disease treatment, and clean energy were not ownership deals with preferred companies or corporate cronies.  \n\n\n\nIndeed, Ip’s warnings mirror our own, as we were the first to accurately, presciently warn—over a year ago—that many of Trump’s economic positions more closely resemble communism than capitalism, as part of what we called “the coming MAGA assault on capitalism.” It certainly looks like MAGA is going Marxist if not even Maoist, especially across Trump’s vicious personal targeting of individual business leaders; government crackdown on business freedom of expression; weaponization of government powers; apparent extortion of businesses; and insertion of government into an unprecedented, outsized role in private sector strategic investment, capital flows and business decision-making.\n\n\n\nMarxism and Maoism were both, of course, expressions of the communist theory that spilled forth from Karl Marx’s pen in the 19th century, brought to life in the brutal one-party states of the Soviet Union and the People’s Republic of China under its leader Mao Zedong, before it evolved into “capitalism with Chinese characteristics” starting in the 1970s, around the time of President Richard Nixon’s fateful visit to Beijing. \n\n\n\nBoth Marxism and Maoism claimed to champion “ordinary people” against corrupt or exploitative elites, while both targeted intellectuals, bureaucrats, and traditionalists, and purged institutions to enforce ideological purity, especially during Stalin’s “Great Terror” and Mao’s “Cultural Revolution.” Both centralized leadership to the point of creating a cult of personality, demanding intense loyalty and the glorification of the sole figure who could fix the country’s problems. Both prized loyalty over expertise, sidelining critics and dissenters in favor of a tightly controlled political narrative. Sound familiar?\n\n\n\nThe essence of market capitalism is that owners—shareholders and the management they appoint share in the profits. These deals give share of profits to government in return for favors. Friedman said that federal government should never own anything—that it should not run a surplus because it would have funds to invest in the private sector. What strategic decision-making rights would the government have in such deals, then?\n\n\n\nAssaults targeting individual business leaders\n\n\n\nTrump has a long history of targeting individual CEOs in highly vicious, personal terms for perceived offenses. This week, Trump called for the firing of Goldman Sachs’ renowned economist Jan Hatzius who accurately called the 2008 financial crisis over the economist’s concern regarding the tariff overhand on the US economy. He also attacked a top-performing financier, David Solomon, the non-partisan CEO of Goldman Sachs, telling him to quit and just be a disc jockey. (Solomon has a famous side hustle as an electronic dance music DJ, known as DJ D-Sol.)\n\n\n\nJust last week, many semiconductor industry observers expressed tremendous discomfort with Trump’s attacks on Lip-Bu Tan, the CEO of Intel, and Trump’s calls for his immediate resignation. Even those who are genuinely concerned by Tan’s documented history of CCP ties and his continuing investments in China, would have preferred that Trump express his views in a more subtle fashion which recognizes the widespread entanglements of the Chinese Communist Party in the largest Chinese businesses. Roughly one-third of the Chinese economy is controlled by CCP-owned enterprises with actual CCP monitors in their boardrooms. Instead of calling this out, the Trump administration appears to want to match such corporate oversight itself.\n\n\n\nVirtually any CEO doing business in China works with companies and schools that have ties to People’s Liberation Army of China, given China’s own authoritarian command economy.  There has been great concern that such prominent Chinese businesses as Huawei, Aviation Industry Corporation of China (AVIC), China Telecom, China Mobile, and Hikvision have close ties to the PLA. Many state-owned enterprises with which most western enterprises do business even have militias with ties to the PLA. While this is concerning across political parties, how can President Trump justifying singling out Intel alone?\n\n\n\nTrump has similarly publicly called out and humiliated leading CEOs ranging from Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan to Brian Moynihan of Bank of America to Doug McMillon of Walmart to Tim Cook of Apple to Matt Levatich of Harley-Davidson, among many others, when they speak the truth about issues ranging from trade policies to HR practices to diplomacy to environmental sustainability.  \n\n\n\nThe unwarranted attack on Brian Moynihan and Bank of America—that they previously denied him as a customer—was particularly alarming as President Trump’s four bankruptcies were reasonable concerns when major banks were approached about lending to him. Bewilderingly, Deutsche Bank’s private wealth unit loaned Trump $48 million—following his default on a $640 million loan from Deutsche Bank’s commercial unit. Now regulators are being told by the Trump Administration to withdraw reputation risk as criteria for reviewing prudent banking practices.\n\n\n\nSuppressing business freedom of expression in favor of political obedience\n\n\n\nThe political right used to complain about the “political correctness of the left.” Similarly, Trump’s history of cracking down on businesses for exercising their freedom of expression resembles the purges of Maoist China far more than American democratic norms.\n\n\n\nFor example, when Merck CEO Ken Frazier resigned from Trump’s Manufacturing Councils in protest over Trump’s infamous response to the Charlottesville rally, claiming there were “fine people” on both sides, Trump lashed out at Frazier, mocking him by saying he’d now have “more time to lower ripoff drug prices”. Similarly, Trump has repeatedly attacked Jeff Bezos, claiming that Amazon was “stealing” from the US Postal Service in the aftermath of critical coverage by the Bezos-owned Washington Post.\n\n\n\nTrump FTC Chairman Andrew Ferguson has publicly challenged woke ideology as a part of his antitrust remit, arguing that “In 2020, if you had a view on masks that was inconsistent with how big tech felt about masks, you weren’t allowed to talk about it. If you had a view on vaccines, couldn’t talk about it. But it wasn’t just big tech censorship. That was a huge problem. Consumers couldn’t go into a store without having political messages pushed in their face. And I’m sitting in 2020 working in the Senate going, gosh, if companies feel like they can alienate half their consumer base without suffering any real competitive consequences, we probably have a competition problem.”\n\n\n\nSimilarly, Trump FCC Chair Brendan Carr has argued that he would use DEI as a basis to block mergers, declaring that “if there are businesses out there that are still promoting invidious forms of DEI discrimination, I really don’t see a path forward where the FCC could reach the conclusion that approving the transaction is going to be in the public interest.”\n\n\n\nAccordingly, to complete it acquisition of Paramount/CBS, David Ellison’s Skydance had to ensure review of its news reporting “to address bias and restore fact-based reporting” with a bias monitor as well as racial hiring practices which met the FCC’s standards under Carr.\n\n\n\nSeizing control of strategic investment and private enterprise decision-making\n\n\n\nAkin to Mao Zedong directing business decisions as a part of his wildly disastrous Great Leap Forward central economic planning initiative, Trump has plunged the US government headfirst into an unprecedented active role in directing private business decision-making and capital flows. Last month, he ordered Coca-Cola CEO James Quincey to replace cane sugar with other sweeteners that the firm uses, despite the lack of scientific evidence supporting such a move and despite the fact that the CEO of Coca-Cola is accountable to his board and shareholders, not Donald Trump.\n\n\n\nThis even extends to the US government directly receiving equity stakes, golden shares, and royalties from business revenues, sometimes as a part of complicated negotiations with the US government and giving off the appearance, whether warranted or not, of drug deals. For example, leading chipmakers Nvidia and AMD were just forced to surrender 15% of the revenue flows from their sales to China to the U.S. government, apparently as a concession to be able to continue selling in that market.\n\n\n\nSimilarly, as a precondition to approving the dangerous takeover of US Steel by the Japanese, Trump extracted a “golden share” for the U.S. government with effective veto power over certain corporate decisions. Likewise, in his first term, Trump attacked Harley-Davidson for supposedly moving factories overseas when in reality 100% of its beloved motorcycles sold in the U.S. are actually made in the U.S. Out of sheer political spite, Trump proclaimed that American bikers should buy from Harley’s foreign competitors, ranting that Harley had “surrendered” and “betrayed” America while threatening “they will be taxed like never before.”\n\n\n\nLikewise, Trump wrongly accused Ford of robbing Detroit of jobs when it relocated an engine plant from Europe to Mexico, fortifying its North American supply chain. When one of us personally corrected Trump on that, he replied, “I don’t care, it’s working.” At the same time, the home appliances firm Carrier had a parallel experience with Trump-bashing them, despite being located in Mike Pence’s home state of Indiana.\n\n\n\nPolitical weaponization of government powers \n\n\n\nTrump targeted AT&T with a drawn-out antitrust suit as well as numerous personal taunts when it tried to merge with Time Warner, hoping to pressure CNN to become more friendly in its coverage. In stark contrast, Trump pal Rupert Murdoch received the white-gloves treatment through antitrust when he sold 21st Century Fox at around the same time, despite arguably more genuine antitrust concerns. \n\n\n\nIn fact, Trump antitrust chief Makan Delrahim expressed support for the AT&T-Time Warner combination as an academic but flipped 180 degrees to appease Trump once in office, holding up the deal for two years. Likewise, before his first term ran out, Trump personally drove a proposed deal that would have secured TikTok for his longtime supporter and friend Larry Ellison at Oracle, unusually inserting himself into every detail of the negotiation process.\n\n\n\nThe appearance of extortion and bribery\n\n\n\nAs prominent media commentators such as Oliver Darcy and Matt Belloni point out, some of Trump’s demands resemble extortion. There was the payment of $16 million to the Trump Presidential Library from CBS News’ 60 Minutes over the standard editing of an interview with Kamala Harris last summer. This occurred over the objections of its executive producer (who resigned in protest), and while FCC approval was pending of Paramount’s acquisition by Skydance.\n\n\n\nThis was followed by the cancellation of the modern “King of Comedy,” Stephen Colbert, whose revered late show suddenly had its deal abruptly canceled on the eve of Trump’s FCC merger approval, seemingly over its satirical criticism of the Trump administration. The explanation that the show was too expensive and lost money raised many eyebrows, particularly given the lack of attempts to trim the 200-person production staff.\n\n\n\nSimilar lawsuits initiated by Trump in office against private businesses give off a similar appearance of extortion and bribery, whether justified or not. These include Trump’s $100 million lawsuit against The Wall Street Journal for reporting about a letter Trump wrote to Jeffrey Epstein for his 50th birthday; and Disney/ABC’s $15 million payment to the Trump Presidential Library to settle defamation claims against George Stephanopoulos.\n\n\n\nAcross each of these five dimensions, one can’t help but think MAGA is going Marxist or full Maoist. Adam Smith’s salute to the “invisible hand” of free markets in favor of the fist of government appears to be losing out in the Trump administration. as these unprecedented policies with no parallel in American history share much more in common with Karl Marx and Mao Zedong than Adam Smith and Ayn Rand. Many now wonder why the Business Roundtable remains missing in action, insulating itself with turgid knowledge, subtracting white papers and passive forums, piously genuflecting to President Trump’s assaults on free-market capitalism that make New York’s Mamdani look like John D. Rockefeller.\n\n\n\nThe Marxist-style oppression of free enterprise was echoed in assaults on the nation’s top law firms and universities through authoritarian blitzkriegs to suppress constitutionally protected American ideals of freedom of expression, a cornerstone of capitalism. Harvard University, like 60 other universities, has been threatened with a cutoff of foreign-born students and vital federal research funds under the false pretext of antisemitism, despite the Anti-Defamation League giving Harvard passing grades on its tests for antisemitism. Paul Weiss is one of many major law firms that the Trump administration threatened with having its security clearance and federal building access denied, merely by offering to represent independent citizen voices attacked by Trump for noncompliance with his thought police and MAGA political correctness. We have spoken in admiration of the hundreds of universities and law firms that have now unified to stop these totalitarian White House edicts. The legal and academic community remembered what the Business Roundtable and genuine traditional economic conservatives have forgotten, which was Benjamin Franklin’s admonition that “we must all hang together or surely we will hang separately.”\n\n\n\nThe authors would like to thank Steven Tian and Stephen Henriques from the Yale Chief Executive Leadership Institute for their research.\n\n\n\nThe opinions expressed in Fortune.com commentary pieces are solely the views of their authors and do not necessarily reflect the opinions and beliefs of Fortune.Introducing the 2025 Fortune Global 500, the definitive ranking of the biggest companies in the world.

Santiago/Getty Images News via Getty ImagesA new report has emerged, revealing a significant impact on American Eagle‘s stores following the controversy surrounding their jeans ad featuring Sydney Sweeney. The clothing retailer has reportedly suffered a considerable decrease in its foot traffic. The controversial ad campaign launched in late July 2025, following which it was subjected to intense scrutiny. The ad received considerable criticism for its play on the words “jeans” and “genes.” Many accused the actress and the retailer of promoting eugenics and white supremacy via the wordplay.Footfall decreases at American Eagle amid Sydney Sweeney controversyFootfall traffic reportedly decreased by 9% year over year at American Eagle stores for the week starting August 3, 2025. This is the second week the apparel company has experienced traffic declines following the launch of the controversial Sydney Sweeney jeans ad campaign.The report comes from Retail Brew, which had obtained the aforementioned data from the market intelligence website named Pass_by. According to the outlet, foot traffic for American Eagle decreased by 3.9% year over year for the first full week after the ad campaign’s launch on July 27, 2025.Previously, in the two weeks before the ad campaign’s launch, footfall traffic had increased by 5.9% over last year in the week starting July 6 and 4.9% in the week starting July 13.It’s currently unknown if American Eagle and Sydney Sweeney’s jeans ad controversy influenced the decline in footfall traffic. Moreover, the clothing brand has neither commented on the foot traffic data nor shared whether they have experienced an increase or decrease in traffic and sales following the campaign’s launch. American Eagle’s competitors for younger clothing shoppers have also reportedly experienced drops in their foot traffic. However, the declines were not as big as the retailer’s 9% drop. Abercrombie & Fitch, for instance, saw a -3.3% traffic drop, while Gap experienced a -2.8% drop.While many have criticized American Eagle and Sydney Sweeney’s jeans ad campaign for its alleged promotion of white supremacy and its eugenic undertones, it has found some staunch defenders. President Donald Trump shared on Truth Social that the advertisement was “the ‘HOTTEST’ ad out there.”Meanwhile, Dr. Phil slammed critics of Sweeney’s ad and promised to support the actress and the brand by buying the jeans for female members of his family.The post Sydney Sweeney’s Jeans Controversy Creates Loss for American Eagle — Report appeared first on Mandatory.",
