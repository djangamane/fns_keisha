August 2024. (Photo by BENJAMIN CREMEL/AFP via Getty Images) Getty Images       A suspended Labour councillor will face trial at Crown Court on Monday charged with encouraging violent disorder during an anti-racism demonstration. Ricky Jones, 57, allegedly committed the offence while addressing crowds at the protest in Walthamstow, east London, on August 7 last year.   The court heard Jones allegedly described far-right protesters as \"disgusting Nazi fascists\" and said \"we need to cut their throats and get rid of them\" during his speech. These allegations emerged during a previous court hearing.Video evidence emergesA video appearing to show Jones calling for far-right protesters' throats to be \"cut\" surfaced on social media following the demonstration. The footage became central to the case against the Dartford borough councillor.   The Walthamstow protest was organised in response to nationwide violent disorder that erupted last summer following fatal stabbings at a children's dance class in Southport, Merseyside. The demonstration was part of counter-protests against far-right activity across the country.Trial proceedings begin You may also like Read more from Politics     Cotswolds hamlet in lockdown as JD Vance begins family holiday with huge security operationA sleepy Cotswolds hamlet has been transformed into a security fortress as US Vice President JD Vance begins a family holiday with his wife and three young children.

August 2024. (Photo by BENJAMIN CREMEL/AFP via Getty Images) Getty Images       A suspended Labour councillor will face trial at Crown Court on Monday charged with encouraging violent disorder during an anti-racism demonstration. Ricky Jones, 57, allegedly committed the offence while addressing crowds at the protest in Walthamstow, east London, on August 7 last year.   The court heard Jones allegedly described far-right protesters as \"disgusting Nazi fascists\" and said \"we need to cut their throats and get rid of them\" during his speech. These allegations emerged during a previous court hearing.Video evidence emergesA video appearing to show Jones calling for far-right protesters' throats to be \"cut\" surfaced on social media following the demonstration. The footage became central to the case against the Dartford borough councillor.   The Walthamstow protest was organised in response to nationwide violent disorder that erupted last summer following fatal stabbings at a children's dance class in Southport, Merseyside. The demonstration was part of counter-protests against far-right activity across the country.Trial proceedings begin You may also like Read more from Politics     Cotswolds hamlet in lockdown as JD Vance begins family holiday with huge security operationA sleepy Cotswolds hamlet has been transformed into a security fortress as US Vice President JD Vance begins a family holiday with his wife and three young children.

    "content": "Kemi Badenoch appeared to suggest the setting up of migrant “camps” when speaking about possible alternatives to using hotels to house asylum seekers – comments which have been dubbed “deeply troubling” by refugee campaigners.As she met members of the community in Epping, Essex, the Conservative Party leader said: “We’ve got to turn things around very quickly. We cannot use rules from 1995, or 2005, or even 2015 for 2025.\n“Our world is changing very quickly, and we need to adapt to it.”\nMs Badenoch, who is attempting to persuade voters that the Tories can be trusted on the issue of migration in the face of a growing threat from Reform UK,  added: “Is it possible for us to set up camps and police that, rather than bringing all of this hassle into communities?\n“As a party, we need to also hear from the community about what you think the solutions are. We don’t have all the answers; it’s important that we make sure that the community is part of the problem solved.”\nResponding to her remarks, Refugee Action’s Tim Naor Hilton told The Independent: “It’s deeply troubling that our political leaders appear to be in a race to the bottom for who can treat people seeking asylum the most cruelly. \n“It is creating an incendiary atmosphere in our communities that is emboldening dangerous far-right groups and leading to racist attacks on people seeking asylum. \n“Hostile policies and rhetoric must stop now. People must be treated with dignity and housed properly in our communities so they can rebuild their lives in peace.” \nIt comes amid mounting tensions over asylum seekers housed in hotel accommodation in recent days, with protests taking place across the UK.\nMeanwhile, the government is ramping up its efforts to bring down migration amid growing public anger over the issue, announcing on Friday that the new “one in, one out” returns deal with France was up and running. \nThe Home Office has also expanded its “deport now, appeal later” scheme, which sees foreign criminals deported before their appeals have been heard. \nBut Ms Badenoch said the fresh government effort to deport foreign national offenders was “the sort of stuff that they should have been doing on day one”. \nAsked about the recent announcements, she told broadcasters: “When we were deporting criminals, Keir Starmer was writing letters trying to stop our deportations, so I’ll believe it when I see it.\n“This is the sort of stuff that they should have been doing on day one. The fact that they tried to stop deportations before means that I don’t really believe it.\n“The government has released 26,000 prisoners since they came to power, released them early, [and] there are now more criminals on our streets, that’s what I’m really worried about.”\nThe “deport now, appeal later” scheme has been expanded to include offenders from another 15 countries including India, Bulgaria and Australia, bringing the total to 23 countries.\nIt allows the UK to deport offenders who have had a human rights claim against their removal rejected, with any appeals heard from abroad over a video link.\n      Read More               Overhaul of road safety laws ‘much overdue’, experts say\nEpping residents divided over Kemi Badenoch visit\nWatch: Anti-migrant and anti-racism protests held in Bristol\nPalestine Action ban ‘could become Starmer’s poll tax moment’ as backlash grows\nPutin cannot be trusted ‘as far as you could throw him’, Starmer warns\nBlow for Reeves as hiring plans ‘at record low’ in wake of national insurance hike",
